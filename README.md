This project is named "QUOTE MACHINE".
It generates quotes by swiping to the next quote and can return to previous quote.
It reads out loud the current quote on the page using the speech synthesis when the speaker icon is pressed.
You can upgrade the app by modifying it's css and add more quotes in the JavaScript file.
